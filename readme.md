This is a basic 2.5D Raycaster written in C using SDL for windowing. It supports sprites, usable doors and seni-transparent walls.

### 2023 Revisit

The code has been revisited to add a number of new features. Some of the new features include:

* Ceiling and Floor Rendering
* Wall and Floor Decals
* Smooth Cell Lighting with Linear Interpolation and Dynamic Lighting
* Distance Fog
* Skyboxes

In addition, the source code has been revamped significantly. Instead of the "Almost C" C++ that was used before, the code is now purely written in C. The source files have been reorganized into subfolders. The code has been refactored to feature unified code style and naming conventions.
